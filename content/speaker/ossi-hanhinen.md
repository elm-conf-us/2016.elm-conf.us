Have you come into grips with Elm as a language and prolific enough to start
using it in a real project? Awesome! Did you already have an idea of how you
would structure your application, handle authentication and maybe show
toast-like pop up messages in the UI? If not, this talk is for you.

Many people know how to create small apps for fun in Elm. Some have crafted
larger things but felt they were missing something. Having done two larger
customer projects in Elm, I have some solid experience under my belt about
building big applications for production. In both projects, the initial folder
structure and the initial module architecture became untenable in a few months.
This talk is a down-to-earth lessons learned aimed for everyone who has done or
is planning on doing production applications using the language. I will
introduce strategies to overcome some of the common problems we have as frontend
engineers, but also share some war stories of times when things didn’t quite go
as planned.

Ossi is building apps for browsers to run and users to enjoy at Futurice. He
likes to constantly challenge his views on user interface programming, and
lately has gravitated towards functional programming and strong typing with Elm.
Ossi has started two separate customer projects (both of them ongoing) using the
language, making Futurice one of the first commercial users of Elm. He is also
the main person behind Elm Native UI, the open source project trying to make
building mobile apps with React Native possible in Elm, and Keyboard.Extra.
