While Elm pretty much solves the tool and framework fatigue when starting a new
front-end project, we still have the same issue for the back-end. Using Horizon
in your Elm app can help alleviate the pain by reducing the amount of work you
have to do in the back-end, so you can write more Elm code.

When starting a new project in JavaScript, you’re most likely going to spend a
lot of time choosing the tools and frameworks to use, and then spend more time
configuring them. Elm pretty much solves this problem by providing all the
tooling you need out of the box, and by The Elm Community’s preference to have
one way to do things, so you don’t have choose between 100 different packages
just to solve 1 problem.

But, how about the back-end? You still have to choose all the stacks; from
database, web server, programming language, and the framework. At least, until
we have server side Elm, we still have the same problem here.

Wouldn’t it be great if you don’t have to worry about the back-end, and can just
focus on writing Elm code and be happy? We can do that with
[Horizon](http://horizon.io/). Horizon is an open source server designed for
building real time application without writing any back-end code. With Horizon,
all you need to do is to run the Horizon server, start writing Elm code, and be
happy and productive.
