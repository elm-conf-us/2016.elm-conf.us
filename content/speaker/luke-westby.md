I have ADHD and struggle to stay focused on things. This has actually been
helpful in learning JS since things change as quickly as my attention does, but
it makes it hard to finish things. Elm pushes out distractions so I can focus,
and at last the first side-project I’ve ever completed is in Elm!

I’ve lived with ADHD my whole life. There are certainly worse things to live
with, but our world is tailored to people who can concentrate – tasks and
deadlines drive our working society. I’ve spent most of my illustrious career
working with JS, where things change just as quickly as my attention, and it’s
been hard to feel a sense of grounding or belonging. Then I found Elm. Even
though Elm wasn’t designed for people with ADHD explicitly, it is the best
language for those who do to build applications. With Elm, the distractions fall
away and I am able to channel more of the craziness that I experience in my head
into useful work. In this talk I will share my experiences as such a person with
all of you. I hope you’ll come away understanding that using Elm isn’t just good
for applications, it’s good for people. If we can keep the developer’s personal
experiences in mind when building tools and libraries we will have a more
inclusive and accessible community!
