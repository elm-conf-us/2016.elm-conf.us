Games and rich applications present a compelling use-case for Elm, but managing
dynamic animations can quickly become complicated. Here’s how to succinctly
express animation pipelines using the elm-style-animation library and how to
architect your animation code in a readable, extensible manner.

In this talk we’ll cover…

- What options are available for animation in Elm and when it makes sense to use
  them.
- How to tackle real-world animation using the elm-style-animation library.
- A straightforward way to organize animations so that they are readable,
  extensible, and easily integrated into the Elm architecture.

If you’re here, you probably already know that Elm is a solid base for building
complex applications. You’ll come away from this talk with the tools to make
those applications gorgeous as well.
