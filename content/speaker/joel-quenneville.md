Dive into Elm’s random generators on a quest to build a historically accurate
Roman random name generator for the goddess Juno, based on a series of dependent
and independent constraints.

You are an ancient software engineer. Juno, the Roman goddess of marriage and
fertility, surprises you by walking into your office and offering you an
assignment. Overseeing the birth and naming of all Roman children is becoming a
large and monotonous task. She is looking to modernize and automate. Will you
build her a piece of software to randomly generate valid information for a Roman
child?

Join us on the quest to complete this project using Elm’s random generators.
Along the way, we will see how to create complex generators out of simple ones,
how to handle dependent and independent constraints, and how to work with
percentages and Maybe. You will leave with a firm grasp of how Elm handles
randomness in a functional manner and the confidence to implement your own
generators.

Joël is a software developer at thoughtbot. He is passionate about best
practices and building excellent software. Although he got his start with
dynamically typed imperative languages, he has recently become fascinated with
the statically typed functional world and Elm in particular. Outside of
programming, Joël loves to study history. He often combines these two interests
together to play with historically-themed software side projects.
