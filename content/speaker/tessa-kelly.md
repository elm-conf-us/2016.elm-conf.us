Elegant data structures are different across programming languages, and creating
them should be approached differently. Leverage Elm’s union types to build
simple and readable structures, beginning with binary trees.

<!--more-->

Writing a binary tree might be a familiar task in JavaScript or Ruby, and it
might seem like a very similar problem in Elm. While it’s possible to create
data structures in Elm that are very similar to ones written in languages that
aren’t strictly functional and that don’t have types, there are better
approaches. This talk will explore a few different implementations and
recommendations, and assumes an audience without extensive academic ML-family
language experience.

As a software engineer at NoRedInk, Tessa reads, writes, and extends a lot of
Elm code. Before joining NoRedInk, Tessa spent her time thinking about
curricula, learning, and engagement in the context of teaching web development.
She holds a BA in Mathematics from New York University, where she also minored
in History and in Middle Eastern Studies.
