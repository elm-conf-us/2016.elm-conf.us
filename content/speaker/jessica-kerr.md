I love the explicitness and structure of Elm. I don’t love typing.

A mechanical friend can help with both: smart templates modify code to perform
common tasks, and Github PRs keep this safe and editor-independent.

I love the explicitness and the consistent structure of Elm code and the Elm
Architecture. Sometimes I don’t love the typing involved.

Elm is well-suited to code generation. We like to generate code (like with
html2elm) and modify it. The automation doesn’t have to end there!

This session will demonstrate growing an Elm app with the help of a smarter
templating engine and Github pull requests. Tasks like “add a new component” or
“start using elm-test” or “change a service contract” happen safely and
mechanically, outside of your favorite editor.

Keep all the structure, skip some of the tedium. See another reason that Elm can
be our most productive language system yet.

Jessica Kerr (better known as Jessitron) works on deployment at Stripe. She
writes Ruby, Scala, Go, you name it. She speaks at conferences in the US,
Europe, and Australia. She podcasts as a Ruby Rogue, parents two daughters, and
writes Elm for fun. Look for her in St. Louis, San Francisco, and wherever
functional programming and silliness meet.
